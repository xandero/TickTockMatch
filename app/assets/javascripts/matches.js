// Create small div on LHS with thumbnail photo of the matchedUser.
// Display matchedUser name at top of div.
// if both questions have been answered 
//    display the last message of the conversation within the div
//   else 
//     there are no messages, display "No messages...yet"
//   end
// else if one or more questions not answered
//   if thisUser has not answered the question
//     show "your question awaits!" (also show this message if neither have answered)
//   else
//     the matchedUser has not answered, show "awaiting answer from your match"
//   end

// On 'click' of each match div, 
//   if conversation with match_id (for this div, which will be either its ID or in its data field) exists
//     load conversation.js
//   else
