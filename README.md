<h3>Overview</h3>

Qatch is currently a work in progress, and is not yet ready for use. A working version should be ready by mid-April 2015. 

<h3>Primary Functionality</h3>

When complete, the app will allow users to browse the profiles of other users and choose whether or not to initiate a match. If both users choose to match, they will then be presented with the recipricator's question. The answer to this question will need to be approved by the recipricator, and vice versa, before the users can communicate with each other. 

<h3>Gems, Libraries and Add-ons</h3>

- Geocoder (API)
- Carrierwave (file upload)
- jQuery (library)
- Underscore (library)

<h3>Database</h3>

ActiveRecord and Postgres are used to manage the database. If you would like to setup your own instance of the site, use 'rake' to create and migrate the database.

<h3>Bugs</h3>

There are bugs. I'm working on them.

<h3>Thanks and Acknowledgements</h3>

Huge thanks to Joel and Jack for the ongoing assistance, and for giving me a leg up in starting my long climb out of the abyss.
